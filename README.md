A full-screen Gif Looper

Heavily inspired by GifDrift - a beautiful web experience made by my Makers coach and genius Kay Lovelace.
After being mesmerised by her GifLoops,
I wanted to create a tailored GifDrift experience that I could customise to suit my own written music.

I also wanted to experiment with a widely-used API - Giphy's is used in whatsapp, tinder, slack, twitter;
for whatever reason these snappy animations seem to express ourselves well.

Website, search engine.
Returns first five GIFs based on search terms.
Loops them in sequence, full-screen.

Ruby, Sinatra, Capybara, Rspec, Cucumber, Giphy API (https://developers.giphy.com/docs/)
